# Mapping Tokens

Mapping is necessary in order to transfer your assets to and from the Ethereum and Polygon. We offer two bridges to do the same. More details on the bridge can be understood from [here](/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/getting-started).

:::tip

The Polygon PoS bridge is available for both mainnet as well as Mumbai testnet. More information about the bridge can be found [<ins>here</ins>](/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/pos/getting-started).

## Steps to submit a mapping request

In order to map tokens between Ethereum and Polygon, you have to submit a mapping request. It has to be submitted on [https://mapper.polygon.technology/](https://mapper.polygon.technology/). Open the link and click on the **'Map New Token'** button on the top right corner to create a new mapping request.

**Step 1 &rarr;** Choose the network on which you want to map tokens. You can choose Goerli-Mumbai for Testnet, and Ethereum-Polygon for the Mainnet.

**Step 2 &rarr;** Select the type of token you are mapping from **'ERC20'**, **'ERC721'**, or **'ERC1155'**. For mapping any other token standard, you can reach out to the Polygon team on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/0xPolygon) or create a ticket [here](https://support.polygon.technology/support/home) and keep "Token Mapping" in the ticket title.

**Step 3 &rarr;** Enter your **Ethereum / Goerli** token address in the **"Ethereum Token Address"** field. Make sure your token contract code has been verified on the [Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/) / [Goerli](https://goerli.etherscan.io/) blockchain explorers. if your root token is verified ✅, the **name**, **symbol**, and **decimal** fields will be automatically filled and these fields are uneditable.

**Step 4 &rarr;** You can choose the mapping to be either **'Mintable'** or **'Non-Mintable'** on Polygon. More details on the Polygon Mintable tokens can be found [here](https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/mintable-assets).

:::info

Make sure you verify the checklist for the selected type of mapping: **Mintable** or **Non-Mintable**.

The tokens that will be minted on Polygon first and subsequently migrated to Ethereum are called **Mintable** tokens. Meanwhile, tokens that already exist on Ethereum but have to be moved to Polygon are referred to as **Non-Mintable** tokens.

:::

In case of a custom token mapping, you can visit our [Fx-Portal](/docs/develop/l1-l2-communication/fx-portal.md) and use the data provided to build your custom token.

## Mapping checklist

### Mintable tokens

:::tip

Checkout the documentation for mintable tokens available [<ins>here</ins>](/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/mintable-assets.md).

:::

1. The `deposit` and `withdraw` function is present in the ***child*** token contract. (Reference Template Contract - [ERC20](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildMintableERC20.sol#L1492-#L1519), [ERC721](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildMintableERC721.sol#L2160-#L2275), [ERC1155](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildMintableERC1155.sol#L1784-#L1851))
2. Only the ChildChainManagerProxy address has the right to call the `deposit` function. (ChildChainManagerProxy - on [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb5505a6d998549090530911180f38aC5130101c6/transactions), on [Polygon Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xA6FA4fB5f76172d178d61B04b0ecd319C5d1C0aa/))
3. The root chain contract is a standard [ERC20](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/DummyMintableERC20.sol#L1481) / [ERC721](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/DummyMintableERC721.sol#L2169) / [ERC1155](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/DummyMintableERC1155.sol#L1785)
4. The `mint` function on the ***root*** contract can only be called by the corresponding token, **PredicateProxyAddress** (PredicateProxyAddress for each token type can be found [here](/docs/develop/ethereum-polygon/mintable-assets.md#contract-to-be-deployed-on-ethereum))

### Non-Mintable tokens

1. The `deposit` and `withdraw` functions are present in the ***child*** token contract. (Reference Template Contract - [ERC20](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildERC20.sol#L1492-#L1508), [ERC721](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildERC721.sol#L2157-#L2238), [ERC1155](https://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/blob/master/flat/ChildERC1155.sol#L1784-#L1818))
2. Only the **ChildChainManagerProxy** address has the right to call the `deposit` function. (ChildChainManagerProxy - on [Mumbai](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xb5505a6d998549090530911180f38aC5130101c6/transactions) , on [Polygon Mainnet](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xA6FA4fB5f76172d178d61B04b0ecd319C5d1C0aa/))
3. `mint` function is an internal function. (This gets called by deposit function internally)
